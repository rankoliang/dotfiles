# dotfiles

## Introduction

This is currently a work in progress. If you are looking to copy these dotfiles, I strongly encourage you to only use these as inspiration only and customize to your own needs. Use at your own risk. I use currently use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to create symlinks of the necessary files to my home folder. I also have a `local/.gitconfig.local` file that the [.gitconfig file](git/.gitconfig) will link to similar to this:

```
[user]
email=email@gmail.com
name=First Last
```
Some other packages I have are [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa), but this is not an exhaustive list.
